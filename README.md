### Contributions Guide for GitHub beginners:

#### 1) Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one. Visit www.github.com and sign up. You'll need to pick a username, provide an email address, and choose a password.

#### 2) Fork the Repository
Once you have a GitHub account, navigate to the repository's page on GitHub at: https://github.com/timechainb/timechain-calendar-translations. Once there, click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. This will create a copy of my repository under your GitHub account.

#### 3) Make the Changes
Now that you have a forked copy of the repository, you can make changes. If you're editing an existing file, navigate to that file in your forked repository and click the "Edit" button, which looks like a pencil. You can then make your changes in the web-based text editor.â€¨If you're adding a new file, navigate to the directory where the file should go, then click the "Add file" button and choose "Create new file". You can then input the file's content in the web-based text editor.

#### 4) Propose the Changes
Once you've made your changes, scroll down to the "Propose changes" section. Here you can add a short description of what changes you've made. This will be visible to me when you submit your changes. Once you've added your description, click the "Propose changes" button. This will take you to a new page summarizing your changes.

#### 5) Create a Pull Request
On this new page, click the "Create pull request" button. This will take you to another new page where you can add more details about your changes, if necessary. Once you've done this, click the "Create pull request" button again. This submits your changes to me for review.
